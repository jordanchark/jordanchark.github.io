I'll be giving a talk at the main session of <a href="https://ichl.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/">ICHL25</a> at Oxford. The title of my talk is "Subordinate Contexts Can Be Innovative: Evidence from the History of Icelandic". Through the lens of historical Icelandic, I argue that it is crucial to account for register effects when considering the dynamics of change.
