I gave a talk at Formal Diachronic Semantics (FoDS) 6 (virtually) at the University of Cologne. The title is "A formal account of the diachrony of the Icelandic ‘finish’ perfect". The <a href="http://www.lukasz-jedrzejowski.eu/conferences/FoDS6/revised_chark_slides_fods.pdf">slides</a> can be found here.
