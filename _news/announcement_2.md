I gave a talk at the <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/events">Psychosemantics Colloquium</a> (organised by Nicole Gotzner and Nadine Bade) at the University of Potsdam. The talk was entitled "Experimenting with social meaning" and discussed ongoing experimental work (which I am co-author on alongside Uli Sauerland and Stephanie Solt) in our project "Modeling meaning-driven variation".
