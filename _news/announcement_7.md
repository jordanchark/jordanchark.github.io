I will be giving a presentation along with Uli Sauerland (presenting joint work with Stephanie Solt and Roland MÃ¼hlenbernd) at <a href="https://spe-uca.sciencesconf.org/">Semantics and Philosophy in Europe 12</a> entitled "Social meaning has multiple sources: form vs. meaning driven variation in language use". The abstract can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14EgKaxUzJzh1pzXQNBQhKAURVvOPakjV/view">here</a>.
