I am part of the scientific staff (wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin) at the institute for German language and linguistics (Institut für deutsche Sprache und Linguistik) at the <a href="https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/de">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</a>, associated with the <a href="https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/">Collaborative Research Centre (DE: Sonderforschungsbereich) 1412 "Register"</a> (Project A10; PIs <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/viola-schmitt/home">Viola Schmitt</a> and <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/people/details/alexiadou-artemis/alexiadou-artemis">Artemis Alexiadou</a>). 

In Project A10, we are interested in seemingly optional morphosyntactic doubling (e.g. two comparative morphemes in <i>more taller</i>) and the consequences thereof for our understanding of how situational dimensions interface with the choices speakers make from sets of available alternatives. Doubling results in more redundancy, which we hypothesise ought to be advantageous in situational contexts involving some degree of uncertainty regarding the question-under-discussion.

## Previously

Before coming to HU, I was a doctoral researcher for three years at the <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/">Leibniz-Centre for General Linguistics (ZAS)</a> in Berlin, also affiliated with CRC 1412.

I succesfully defended my doctoral dissertation in November, 2024. Its title is "Understanding meaning-driven variation along the grammaticalisation trajectory: the case of Icelandic <i>búinn</i>", written under the supervision of <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/people/details/sauerland-uli/uli-sauerland/">Uli Sauerland</a>, <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/people/details/solt-stephanie/stephanie-solt">Stephanie Solt</a> and <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/people/details/alexiadou-artemis/alexiadou-artemis">Artemis Alexiadou</a>. 

Prior to my employment at HU and ZAS, I did an MSc. in General Linguistics at the <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/index">University of Potsdam</a>. During my time in Potsdam, I did research on modality in Finnish using semantic fieldwork methodology (my MSc. thesis) as well as conducted theoretically-driven experiments on embedded questions (in the XPrag.de ExQ project). 

These days, I work mostly on Icelandic (with ocassional forays into other North Germanic languages, as well as German). My interest in the Icelandic language began from a young age. I did my undergraduate studies at the <a href ="https://english.hi.is/">University of Iceland</a>, where I developed a nascent interest in historical linguistics, linguistic variation and language ideology.
