My research primarily focuses on the interfaces between sociolinguistics and semantics/pragmatics. My ongoing dissertation work approaches the question of how intra-individual variation in synchrony (broadly: register competence) relates to language change through the lens of pragmatic reasoning. To do so, I investigate a couple case studies from the history of Icelandic. I draw on a number of methods in my research: experimental, corpus, and computational. Furthermore, I endeavour to approach my work in a holistic fashion whereby synchronic and diachronic, sociolinguistic and formal semantic/pragmatic research are in constant dialogue.

I situate my work more broadly within <a href="https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/">Collaborative Research Centre (DE: SFB) 1412 "Register"</a>, <a href="https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/projects/a05/">Project A05 "Modeling meaning-driven register variation"</a>, based at the <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/">Leibniz Centre for General Linguistics (ZAS)</a> in Berlin, Germany. The project deals with so-called non-equivalent alternatives: situational alternations between linguistic expressions that have functional overlap but are logically distinct. For instance, "7:53" as opposed to "8 o'clock". These differ from prototypical sociolinguistic variables, which are logically equivalent. Logical overlap, however, necessitates the activation of pragmatic reasoning, which makes certain predictions. We are interested in the relationship between this pragmatic reasoning, on the one hand, and the social meaning evoked by the choice of a given alternative.

Before coming to ZAS, I did an MSc. in General Linguistics at the University of Potsdam, under the guidance of Malte Zimmermann. During my time in Potsdam, I did research on modality in Finnish using semantic fieldwork methodology (my MSc. thesis) as well as conducted theoretically-driven experiments on embedded questions (in the XPrag.de ExQ project). 

These days, I work mostly on Icelandic (with ocassional forays into other north Germanic languages, as well as German). My interest in the Icelandic language began from a young age. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Iceland, where I developed a nascent interest in language change and variation. I am continuously grateful to the Icelandic linguistics community for making it feel like I work on a language much more widely-spoken; the resources are that great.
