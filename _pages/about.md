I am part of the scientific staff (wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin) at the institute for German language and linguistics (Institut für deutsche Sprache und Linguistik) at the <a href="https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/de">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</a>, associated with the <a href="https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/">Collaborative Research Centre (DE: Sonderforschungsbereich) 1412 "Register"</a> (Project A10; PIs <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/viola-schmitt/home">Viola Schmitt</a> and <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/people/details/alexiadou-artemis/alexiadou-artemis">Artemis Alexiadou</a>). 

My primary <a href="https://jordanchark.github.io/research/">research interests</a> are formal semantics/pragmatics, sociolinguistics and the interfaces between them. My work often incorporates a diachronic dimension; I strongly believe that such a perspective strengthens the analysis of any linguistic phenomenon.

In Project A10, we are interested in seemingly optional morphosyntactic doubling (e.g. two comparative morphemes in <i>more taller</i>) and the consequences thereof for our understanding of how situational dimensions interface with the choices speakers make from sets of available alternatives. Doubling results in more redundancy, which we hypothesise ought to be advantageous in situational contexts involving some degree of uncertainty regarding the question-under-discussion.

Before coming to HU, I was a doctoral researcher for three years at the <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/">Leibniz-Centre for General Linguistics (ZAS)</a> in Berlin, also affiliated with CRC 1412. My <a href="https://jordanchark.github.io/projects/">dissertation project</a> concentrated on understanding how register-specific alternations can emerge, focusing on a case study from the diachrony of Icelandic. 

Prior to that, I did an MSc. in General Linguistics at the <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/index">University of Potsdam</a>. I did my undergraduate studies at the <a href ="https://english.hi.is/">University of Iceland</a>, where I developed a nascent interest in historical linguistics, linguistic variation and language ideology.
